# Ghost-Of-Khotun-Khan
A java game made in 1.4. Based of the game "Ghost Of Tsushima", its instead turnbased and story focused.

Its coded in Java 1.4 due to IDE limitations, but its still a solid game. Turnbased & with a leveling system. 

All encounters are also random, and the game scales with your own level.  The score at the end is also variable, so always aim higher!
