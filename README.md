# Ghost-Of-Khotun-Khan
A java game made in 1.4. Based of the game "Ghost Of Tsushima", its instead turnbased and story focused.

Its coded in Java 1.4 due to IDE limitations, but its still a solid game. Some features are Leveling, Turn-based combat & a gripping story!

All encounters are also random, and the game scales with your own level.  The score at the end is also dependant on how well you play, so aim higher!
